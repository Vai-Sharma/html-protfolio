    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>I am a first-year B.Tech student specializing in Computer Science and Engineering
         with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I am passionate about 
         exploring the potential of technology to solve real-world problems and have a strong 
         interest in programming, prompt engineering, and creative tech solutions. I am currently building a solid foundation in AI/ML while actively engaging 
         in hands-on learning and projects.</p>

    <p>One of the projects I have worked on is a wearable emergency alert device 
         connected to a mobile app that notifies authorities during critical situations.
         This project reflects my drive to build meaningful, user-focused innovations 
         that can make a real difference. I enjoy combining technical knowledge with creativity, 
         and I am always looking for opportunities to learn and build solutions that are both functional
         and impactful.</p>   

    <p> My goal is to grow as a developer and contribute to the field of AI/ML in ways that are ethical, 
         efficient, and accessible. I also value personal wellness, productivity, and mindful living—principles 
         I try to integrate into my daily routine as a student. I believe in learning by doing and am excited to 
         continue my journey of growth and innovation.</p>
